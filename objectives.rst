PacSAFE is based on QGIS and the InaSAFE plugin, and was originally developed by SPC, funded by the Asian Development Bank as part of the project Strengthening Disaster and Climate Risk Resilience in Urban Development (TA-8238-REG).

InaSAFE was originally developed by the Australian Government in partnership with The National Disaster Management Authority (BNPB) Indonesia, and the World Bank-(GFDRR).

The |project_name| Project is a response to demand from Pacific Island
Countries as a part of the suite of tools envisaged under the Secretariat
of Pacific Community Geoscience Division's Pacific Risk Information System.
The Project will collaborate with representatives from the Fijian National
Disaster Management Office (NDMO) and the Tongan National Emergency 
Management Office (NEMO) in the planning, preparation and response to 
natural disasters.
The |project_name| software tool is a QGIS plugin leveraging the
capabilities of InaSAFE. It was originally designed and developed by SPC 
and together with Geoscience Australia, the Australian Government's 
technical geoscience agency will continue the development and deployment
of PacSAFE.

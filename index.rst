The PacSAFE project is a response to demand from Pacific Island
Countries for tools to better understand disaster impacts. The project 
will engage with representatives from national disaster management 
offices and related agencies who are involved in planning for,
preparing for and responding to natural disasters. 
The PacSAFE software tool, initially developed by the Pacific Community
(SPC), is a desktop tool based on QGIS and InaSAFE to interact with
hazard and asset data, such as the Pacific Catastrophic Risk and 
Financing Initiative (PCRAFI) asset database. 
The PacSAFE project, funded by the Government of Australia, with 
technical support from Geoscience Australia, aims to provide the tools 
and capability to enhance the ability of disaster managers to make
informed decisions for disaster response and to develop evidence-based
policies for enhancing disaster resilience.

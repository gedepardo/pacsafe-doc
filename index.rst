The PacSAFE project is a response to demand from Pacific Island
Countries for tools to better understand disaster impacts. The PacSAFE
software tool is designed and developed for national disaster
management offices and related agencies involved in planning for,
preparing for and responding to natural disasters. The PacSAFE
software tool was initially developed by the Pacific Community (SPC)
for urban planners to interact with hazard and asset data, such as the
Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI)
asset database. The PacSAFE project, funded by the Government of
Australia, with technical support from Geoscience Australia, aims to
provide a tool that will enhance the ability of disaster managers to
prepare for and respond to disasters, and to reduce the impacts of
disasters on the local population and infrastructure.

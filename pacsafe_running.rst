Running PacSAFE
===============

Introduction
------------

In this exercise, we will work through an example scenario where we show how the different data elements used by PacSAFE are combined in order to analyse the potential impact of a tsunami on both the buildings and population.

After we have run the PacSAFE analysis we will print the map and analysis report as a pdf and review the results. We will also learn how to change the inundation threshold and take a look at the default settings for minimum needs. We will also learn how to save our work.

Learning objective
------------------

To develop the participant's basic understanding of the InaSAFE workflow and application of InaSAFE in the Disaster Management sector. By the end of this exercise, participants will:


*   Be able to run a tsunami analysis using PacSAFE - on buildings;

*   Understand the tsunami impact default settings;
*   Understand the impact summary report;
*   Be able to change the analysis threshold and run a new scenario;
*   Be able to generate a PDF map from the results of an analysis; and
*   Be able to save their work to share results with others.

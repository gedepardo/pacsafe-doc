Run basic PacSAFE
=================

Introduction
------------

In this exercise, we will work through an example scenario where we
show how the different data elements used by PacSAFE are combined in
order to analyse the potential impact of a tsunami on both the
buildings and population.

After we have run the PacSAFE analysis we will print the map and
analysis report as a pdf and review the results. We will also learn
how to change the inundation threshold and take a look at the default
settings for minimum needs. We will also learn how to save our work.

Learning objective
..................

To develop the participant's basic understanding of the PacSAFE
workflow and application of PacSAFE in the Disaster Management
sector. By the end of this exercise, participants will:


*   Be able to run a tsunami analysis using |project_name| - on buildings;
*   Be able to run a tsunami analysis using |project_name| - on population;
*   Understand the tsunami impact default settings;
*   Understand the impact summary report;
*   Be able to change the analysis threshold and run a new scenario;
*   Be able to generate a PDF map from the results of an analysis; and
*   Be able to save their work to share results with others.



Data for this exercise
......................

The data for this exercise are packaged in the PacSAFE
application. There is no need to download data to run the exercises.

Exercise
--------

Open |project_name| application
...............................

Before running a |project_name| analysis, we must open a
project. Start |project_name| by double clicking the |project_name|
icon on the desktop.

.. image:: /images/icon.ico
   :align: center


A splash screen will appear for a few seconds, then the main
|project_name| interface will be displayed.

.. image:: /images/splash.png
   :align: center


Choose a disaster scenario
..........................

Clicking on the |project_name| button in the |project_name| toolbar
will open a new window, with a list of projects that you can select
from.

.. figure:: /images/001_project_selection.png
   :align: center

   Project selection window for PacSAFE.

We will start by examining the scenario of a tsunami and it's impact
on buildings in and around Nuku'alofa. Select the "Nukualofa tsunami
buildings" project in the list, then click the :guilabel:`Load` button.

The project will show several layers, including:

* Buildings: this is the exposure data. This will be used to assess
  the tsunami impact on buildings.
* Tsunami: this is the hazard data. It is used to determine the
  inundation depth from a tsunami.
* Imagery: this is contextual data, and is aerial imagery over
  Nuku'alofa. This provides a sense of place and scale when viewing
  the results of analysis. It is not used in the analysis.

Use the panning tools to navigate around the map
(:ref:`navigate`). You might want to find your home, or a local
school.

   :align: center


The contextual data should help you to find features of interest, such
as your home, local school, or church.

Run |project_name| analysis for buildings
-----------------------------------------

Take a look at the |project_name| dock on the right side of the
screen. The |project_name| dock should show that you are ready to run
a tsunami analysis. It poses the question "in the event of **a tsunami
generated by a Mw 9.0 earthquake**, how many **buildings** might **be
inundated**?". This analysis will use the default thresholds for low,
medium and high hazard zones - we will explore that later.

.. figure:: /images/001_analysis_setup.png
   :align: center

   PacSAFE dock showing it is ready to run an analysis.

Notice that the third element in the |project_name| dock, under
"Summarise the results by" is greyed out. This option is used for
aggregating the results (:ref:`aggregation`). We will cover
aggregation in a later exercise.

Click the :guilabel:`Run` button in the lower right corner of the
|project_name| dock to start the analysis process. After a few
seconds, you should get a result in the dock area, and several new
layers should be added to the map. You will see these new layers
listed in the layers panel.

Interpret the results
.....................

The new impact layer will be generated and called **Estimated buildings
affected**. Let's take a look at the new impact layer
generated by |project_name|.

- Zoom in to some area on the map canvas

- Here, we zoomed in to an area near the centre of Nuku'alofa. There will be different colours generated from |project_name| (green, yellow, orange, red).

.. note:: If you dont see these colours, you might need to turn off the data layer above the "Estimated buildings affected" layer. 

..note:: In this analysis, there are very few green buildings so there may not be any in the map extents. 

- The building points are all coloured according to the depth of inundation:

  * The red buildings points are inundated to a depth of 3 metres or more 
  * Orange building points inundated between 1.0 and 3.0 metres
  * Yellow building points are inundated between 0.1 and 1.0 metres
  * Green building points are inundated no more than 0.1 metres
  * Grey building pointss are considered *unaffected*, as they are situated in dry areas according to the inundation model.
  

Click :guilabel:`Number of buildings` in the layer list to select it
and click :guilabel:`Identify Feature` tool and then click on a
building to view the attributes of that building.

In the |project_name| panel we now see the impact summary. The details
of this summary table are explained below.

.. image:: /images/001_basic_pacsafe_impact_summary.png
   :align: center
   :width: 200 pt

-  **Hazard Category**: divides the results into several categories
   based on the threshold set in the hazard analysis. In this impact
   summary, |project_name| divides the impact buildings into two
   categories: number of buildings in **Medium** or **High** hazard
   zones - labeled *affected* (buildings inundated by more than 1.0
   metres of water) and those considered *not affected*, which are
   those buildings in a **Low** hazard zone or **Dry** (buildings not
   affected by any water).

-  **Structure type:** divides the exposed buildings into several
   categories based on the building type attribute for each
   building. In this impact summary, |project_name| breaks down the results
   into a more detailed report by looking at each type of the
   building, for example the number of inundated hospitals and the
   total number of hospitals in analysis area.

-  **Action checklist:** designed to make disaster managers think about
   what they need to do/discuss when planning for a similar event in
   the future.

-  **Notes and assumptions:** provides details about the input data and
   any limitations or assumptions in the analysis or report
   summary. In this example, it explains why buildings are said to be
   inundated, wet and dry.

-  **Aggregation result:** statistical breakdown of the building
   types affected by the simulated event. When you choose to use an aggregation
   layer with your analysis (we will do this later) this table will show the
   number of buildings by aggregation boundary (such as villages).

-  **Analysis details:** explains where the hazard and exposure data
   come from, the aggregation data and the type of impact function
   used in the analysis.

The results show the buildings that will be affected by tsunami inundation of greater than 1.0 metres of water. But what if the disaster manager decides that buildings in 80cm of water are also affected? In order to assess this new scenario, we need to change the water depth threshold at which buildings are considered to be inundated. 

With |project_name| it is easy to run a new scenario, all you need to
do is change the **Thresholds [m]** in the Options tab to 0.8 metres
and run the scenario again.  We will do this in a later session.



Reading the Impact Summary report
.................................


.. figure:: /images/001_impact_summary_tsunami_buildings.png
   :align: center

   Impact summary report for tsunami on buildings analysis.

Notice how the "Analysis detail" section has sub-headings "High hazard
zone", "Medium hazard zone" and "Low hazard zone"? You can select the
thresholds that define these zones, using the "Keyword Creation
Wizard".

Print and Save your |project_name| Results
..........................................

We can also print the analysis results; the impact map and the impact summary,
as two separate pdf files. To print |project_name| result:

1. Click :guilabel:`Print` at the bottom of the |project_name| panel.

2. A window will pop up as shown below.

.. image:: /static/training/socialisation/run_basic_12.*
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt

- **Area to print**: leave this set to the default **analysis extent**.

- **Template to use**: leave this set to the **default portrait - a3**.

For more information about printing, click :guilabel:`Help` in the print window.

3. Click :guilabel:`Open PDF`.

4. Navigate to where you would like to save the PDF. By default,
   the filename is related to the scenario
   (in this case it will say Buildings_inundated)
   but you can name the file name by yourself,
   for example :file:`Nukualofa_tsunami_building_mw9`.
   In this case adding mw9 to the file name reminds us that
   in this tsunami impact scenario, the source earthquake was a Mw 9.0.
   Click :guilabel:`Save`.

Three PDFs will be generated, two show a map with the impact layer and
the third has tables from the impact summary. Take a look at the result.

.. image:: /static/training/socialisation/run_basic_13.*
   :align: center
   :width: 500 pt

We are now already have the impact result in pdf files, but what if we
want to keep the impact result in shapefile? Is the impact result
shapefile automatically stored?

The |project_name| impact result layer is saved in a temporary folder, this means
that it will be automatically deleted if you restart your computer, unless
you save your |project_name| project. If you want to keep your |project_name| results (so
you can refer to them again or share them with others), you need to
manually save the |project_name| impact layer |project_name| as new layer in same
directory as your project.

1. Right click on your |project_name| analysis result, for example **Number of Buildings** or **population which need evacuation**
   and click :guilabel:`Save As...`

2. A new window will appear. Click :guilabel:`Browse…` and name your new layer
   and click :guilabel:`Save` and then click :guilabel:`OK`.

If you want to save your current project you can save it by clicking on
:menuselection:`Project > Save As...` to save your current project. It’s better to
not overwrite the training project so you can do the exercise again later.


Run PacSAFE Analysis for Population
-----------------------------------

Return to the |project_name| toolbar and click on the |project_name| button to open the project selection window. This time, select the "Nukualofa tsunami
population" project in the list, then click the "Load" button.



Summary
-------

In this exercise you have learned how to run a basic |project_name| analysis
using an existing |project_name| project file and what the minimums component that
must be there to run |project_name| properly are. Those components are hazard and
exposure data. In this exercise, you have run an |project_name| impact
assessment for a tsunami scenario in Nuku'alofa using two types of exposure
data. The hazard data you used was a modelled tsunami raster and the
exposure data were buildings and population. These analyses produced
impact layers and impact summaries for affected buildings and impacted
people.

You have also learned how to modify the analysis options through the
Impact Function configuration, how to print |project_name| results in PDF
format, understand what minimum needs is and how to save both your
impact layers and your |project_name| project file.

In the next section you will learn more about how to run |project_name| in more
detail. In that module you will learn how to use more |project_name| tools such
as Agreggation options, OSM Downloader, Minimum Needs Configuration,
etc.

Disaster Risk Management
========================


Before we get into the details of installing and runnign
|project_name|, we first will look at some core themes of disaster
management planning.


This module aims to provide participants with the following knowledge:

* identify and assess potential hazards, sources of vulnerability and
  resulting risks;
* identify opportunities for risk reduction; and
* identify risk reduction methods for their sector.


DRR Content:

* Understanding risk, the causes and the risk management context
  within your country
* Risk Assessments, including processes of hazard assessment,
  vulnerability assessment and risk analysis
* Examples of risk reduction measures, incentives, regulations and
  best practice for implementation
* Implementation of risk reduction, including stakeholder analysis and
  financing mechanisms
* Application of these principles to different sectors

Introduction to Disaster Management content:

* Hazards, Exposure, Vulnerability and Risk
* Principles of Emergency and Disaster Management
* The Disaster Management Cycle
* Development and disasters
* National Disaster Management arrangements, plans and programmes
* Community based disaster management


The disaster management cycle
-----------------------------

*This cycle is commonly used in Australia to describe disaster
 management. How widespread is it in the Pacific? - CA*

The disaster management cycle is a continuous loop that connects four
core elements in managing disasters.

* Preparedness
* Preparation
* Response
* Recovery

**Preparedness** 



Elements of risk
----------------

* Hazard
* Exposure/assets
* Vulnerability



Identifying hazards
-------------------



Exposure
--------

Exposure refers to the assets, populations, and other elements that
are part of the landscape and may be impacted by a hazard event.


Vulnerability
-------------

* Measures of vulnerability
* Vulnerability and fragility


Damage states
.............

The damage state of an asset (e.g. people, buildings) is a qualitative
description of the level of damage suffered by a building (or
components of a building). In some applications, the damage state is
linked to a damage ratio, which quantifies the damage as a fraction of
the complete replacement cost of the building.

An example of damage states for reidential buildings:

+---------------+----------------------------------------+
| Insignificant | No damage, minor non-structural damage |
+---------------+----------------------------------------+
| Light         | Non-structural damage only             |
+---------------+----------------------------------------+
| Moderate      | Reparable structural damage            |
+---------------+----------------------------------------+
| Severe        | Irreparable structural damage          |
+---------------+----------------------------------------+
| Complete      | Complete structural failure            |
+---------------+----------------------------------------+

Damage states are used to inform fragility models - described below.


Fragility
.........

Fragility describes the likelihood of a buillding (or other asset)
reaching or exceeding a particular damage state, based on the
magnitude of the hazard impacting the building.

What is impact?
---------------

* Economic loss
* Casualties
* Damage to buildings, infrastructure, networks, etc.
* Intangible impacts


Impact versus risk
------------------

Impact: outcome of a single event

Risk: Likelihood of different levels of impact due to different events

Risk assessment

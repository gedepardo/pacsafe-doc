Disaster Risk Management
========================


Before we get into the details of using |project_name|, we first will
look at some core themes of disaster management planning.


This module aims to provide participants with the following knowledge:

* understand the concepts of hazard, vulnerability, exposure, impact and risk
* understaning the disaster management cycle
* what are risk and impact assessments



Components of impact and risk
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



Hazard
------

A hazard is considered any natural or human caused event or series of events that may negatively impact the population, infrastructure or resources in a community.


Some examples of natural hazards:

*   a flood (caused by overflowing rivers, storm surge, localised precipitation that cannot drain effectively, or by engineering failure such as a dam or levee breach)
*   an earthquake and the resulting ground shaking that is produced by it
*   a tropical cyclone that causes high winds
*   a tsunami



Some examples of non-natural hazards:

*   a chemical spill
*   a nuclear plant failure
*   an industrial fire / explosion


Vulnerability
-------------

Vulnerability is a measure of susceptibility to the impacts of a
disaster event. This can take the form of structural vulnerability for
buildings and infrastructure hazards, and this is often a quantitative
measure. The vulnerability of a community is influenced by the
characteristics and circumstances that make it susceptible to the
damaging effects of a disaster.

Vulnerability is measured in a range of ways, depending on the element
in question. It is always related to the intensity of the hazard (wind
speed, ground shaking, etc.). For example, the vulnerability of a
house can be measured by the cost of repairs required, compared to the
incident wind speed. 

Social impacts are more difficult to quantify, because different
communities may respond to a disaster in different ways. Poverty and
inequality, marginalisation, social exclusion and discrimination by
gender, social status, disability, pshcological factors and age
(amongst other factors) are all factors that contribute to the
vulnerability of a community. These factors impact the ability to
respond to and recover from a disaster. Quantified measures of social
vulnerability are limited, so it is more common to use qualitative
descriptions.

**Vulnerability and fragility**: occasionally you may hear reference
 to the term *fragility* as well as vulnerability. *Vulnerability* is
 the expected level of damage that would be sustained if a given
 hazard magnitude affected an asset. The vulnerability of a community
 is based on the characteristics and circumstances that make it
 susceptible to the damaging effects of a hazard event. *Fragility*
 refers to the likelihood of a (qualitative) level of damage (e.g. no
 damage, slight, moderate, extensive or complete damage). This can be
 translated into a quantitative estimate of the damage (often referred
 to as a *damage index* or *damage ratio*).

Damage states
.............

The damage state of an asset (e.g. people, buildings) is a qualitative
description of the level of damage suffered by a building (or
components of a building). In some applications, the damage state is
linked to a damage ratio, which quantifies the damage as a fraction of
the complete replacement cost of the building. In this case, it is
possible to determine the direct economic costs of a disaster, based
on the accumulated damage.

An example of damage states for residential buildings for tropical
cyclone winds:

+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Insignificant | Little or no visible damage from the outside. No broken   |
|               | windows, or failed roof deck. Minimal loss of roof cover, | 
|               | with no or very limited water penetration.                |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Light         | Moderate roof cover that can be covered to prevent        |
|               | additional water ingress. One window, door or garage      |
|               | door broken.                                              |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Moderate      | Major roof damage, moderate window breakage. Minor roof   |
|               | sheathing failure. Some water damage to interior.         |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Severe        | Major window damage or roof sheathing loss. Major roof    |
|               | cover loss. Extensive damage to interior from water.      |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Complete      | Complete roof failure and/or failure of wall frame.       |
|               | Loss of more than 50% of roof sheathing.                  |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

Damage state descriptions are routinely used in post-event damage
surveys, to ascertain the impacts of disasters.

Exposure
--------

Exposure refers to the assets, populations, and other elements that
are part of the landscape and may be impacted by a hazard event. This
can include things like buildings, people infrastructure and
agriculture. For example exposure can refer to any or all of the following:

* Buildings: houses, public/government, commercial, industrial, cultural/religious, health, education, etc.
* People: number, demographics (age profile, gender, social disadvantage)
* Infrastructure: power, radio and telecommunications, water and sanitation, roads
* Agriculture: (commercial) crops, subsistence crops, forests, etc.

Often exposure is used to describe only those elements that are in the
footprint of a hazard event. In some other contexts, exposure is used
to refer to all elements in a community.

Impact and risk
+++++++++++++++


Impact
------

Impacts are the outcomes of a disaster on the community, it's people, buildings, landscape and other assets. They can be defined in qualitative terms, or quantitatively measured. Some indicators of impacts include:

* Economic loss
* Casualties, including physical injuries, deaths, mental breakdown
* Number of evacuees
* Damage to buildings, infrastructure, networks, etc.
* Business interruption period
* Intangible impacts such as community breakdown and loss of cultural identity


Risk
----

Risk is the likelihood that a loss will occur as a result of a hazard
event, given the magnitude of hazard, exposed elements and the
vulnerability of those elements. Usually, it is quantified in terms of
economic losses, where we use a range of different measures to
describe risk. It is intrinsically linked to the likelihood of a
disaster event occuring, so often the reported levels of risk link a
loss level to a probability. Measures of risk include:

* Average annual loss - the average loss from disasters over a long period of time.
* Average reccurence interval loss - the loss expected to occur, on average, every 10, 50 or 100 years (or some other frequency)
* Loss-exceedance curves - a graph of the loss from disasters compared to the chance of the disaster occuring.


**Impacts are the outcomes of a single disaster event on the community. Risk describes the likelihood of different levels of impact due to different events.**


The disaster management cycle
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

*This cycle is commonly used in Australia to describe disaster management. How widespread is it in the Pacific? - CA*

The disaster management cycle is a continuous loop that connects four
core elements in managing disasters.

* Prevention
* Preparedness
* Response
* Recovery

   The disaster management cycle.


**Prevention** is the activities and measures taken to avoid existing
and new disaster risks.

**Preparedness** describes the knowledge and capacities of
governements and communities to effectively anticipate, respond and
recover from the impacts of an imminent disaster.

**Response** is the actions taken directly before, during or
immediately after a disaster to save lives, reduce health impacts and
ensure public safety for the people affected by a disaster.

**Recovery** describes the restoration and improvement of the
economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets,
systems and activities of a community to avoid of reduce future
disaster risk.

Represented in a cycle, the recovery phase leads into prevention,
where the goals are the same -- avoiding or reducing future disaster
impacts.

|project_name| can be used to inform the preparedness and response
phases of the disaster management cycle, by enabling emergency
management officers to plan for scenarios and improve the
understanding of resources required to respond quickly and effectively
to a disaster.

Disaster Risk Management
========================


Before we get into the details of installing and running
|project_name|, we first will look at some core themes of disaster
management planning.


This module aims to provide participants with the following knowledge:

* identify and assess potential hazards, sources of vulnerability and
  resulting risks;
* identify opportunities for risk reduction; and
* identify risk reduction methods for their sector.


DRR Content:

* Understanding risk, the causes and the risk management context
  within your country
* Risk Assessments, including processes of hazard assessment,
  vulnerability assessment and risk analysis
* Examples of risk reduction measures, incentives, regulations and
  best practice for implementation
* Implementation of risk reduction, including stakeholder analysis and
  financing mechanisms
* Application of these principles to different sectors

Introduction to Disaster Management content:

* Hazards, Exposure, Vulnerability and Risk
* Principles of Emergency and Disaster Management
* The Disaster Management Cycle
* Development and disasters
* National Disaster Management arrangements, plans and programmes
* Community based disaster management


The disaster management cycle
-----------------------------

*This cycle is commonly used in Australia to describe disaster management. How widespread is it in the Pacific? - CA*

The disaster management cycle is a continuous loop that connects four
core elements in managing disasters.

* Prevention
* Preparedness
* Response
* Recovery

   The disaster management cycle.


**Prevention** is the activities and measures taken to avoid existing
 and new disaster risks.

**Preparedness** describes the knowledge and capacities of
 governements and communities to effectively anticipate, respond and
 recover from the impacts of an imminent disaster.

**Response** is the actions taken directly before, during or
 immediately after a disaster to save lives, reduce health impacts and
 ensure public safety for the people affected by a distaster.

**Recovery** describes the restoration and improvement of the
 economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets,
 systems and activities of a community to avoid of reduce future
 disaster risk.

Represented in a cycle, the recovery phase leads into prevention,
where the goals are the same -- avoiding or reducing future disaster
impacts. 

|project_name| can be used to inform the preparedness and response
phases of the disaster management cycle, by enabling emergency
management officers to plan for scenarios and improve teh
understanding of resources required to respond quickly and effectively
to a disaster.



Elements of risk
----------------

* Hazard
* Exposure/assets
* Vulnerability



Identifying hazards
-------------------



Exposure
--------

Exposure refers to the assets, populations, and other elements that
are part of the landscape and may be impacted by a hazard event. This
can include things like buildings, people infrastructure and
agriculture. This information is often available through


Vulnerability
-------------

Vulnerability is a measure of susceptibility to the impacts of a
disaster event. This can take the form of structural vulnerability for
buildings and infrastructure hazards, and this is often a quantitative
measure. The vulnerability of a community is influenced by the
characteristics and circumstances that make it susceptible to the
damaging effects of a disaster.

* Measures of vulnerability
* Vulnerability and fragility


Damage states
.............

The damage state of an asset (e.g. people, buildings) is a qualitative
description of the level of damage suffered by a building (or
components of a building). In some applications, the damage state is
linked to a damage ratio, which quantifies the damage as a fraction of
the complete replacement cost of the building.

An example of damage states for reidential buildings:

+---------------+----------------------------------------+
| Insignificant | No damage, minor non-structural damage |
+---------------+----------------------------------------+
| Light         | Non-structural damage only             |
+---------------+----------------------------------------+
| Moderate      | Reparable structural damage            |
+---------------+----------------------------------------+
| Severe        | Irreparable structural damage          |
+---------------+----------------------------------------+
| Complete      | Complete structural failure            |
+---------------+----------------------------------------+

Damage states are used to inform fragility models - described below.


Fragility
.........

Fragility describes the likelihood of a buillding (or other asset)
reaching or exceeding a particular damage state, based on the
magnitude of the hazard impacting the building.

What is impact?
---------------

* Economic loss
* Casualties
* Damage to buildings, infrastructure, networks, etc.
* Intangible impacts


Impact versus risk
------------------

Impact: outcome of a single event

Risk: Likelihood of different levels of impact due to different events

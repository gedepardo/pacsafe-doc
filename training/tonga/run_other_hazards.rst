.. _other_hazards:

Running |project_name| with other hazards
=========================================

Introduction
------------

|project_name| was designed to predict the result of a disaster by
giving us the potential impact on buildings, populations and roads
based on specific scenarios.  From previous exercises, we have learned
how to use Basic and Intermediate |project_name| functionality.  We
also learned about using tools in |project_name| such as define
keywords, configure minimum needs and area analysis, using aggregation
as well as many others.

In previous exercises, we used the "flooding in Jakarta" scenario and
related data to learn |project_name| functionality.  In addition to
floods, |project_name| impact analyses can be run for many hazard
types including earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanos. In this exercise,
we will explore and learn to run other hazard scenarios in
|project_name| using |project_name| dock and |project_name| Function
Centric Wizard.  Last but not least, we will also use the Generic
Impact Function.

Learning objectives:
--------------------

To improve the participant's understanding of how to use
|project_name| to run impact analyses for hazards other than floods.
By the end of this exercise, participants will be able to:

- Run |project_name| with other hazards such as Earthquakes, Tsunamis
  and Volcanos;

- Be able to read metadata and assign keywords to hazard data;

- Be able to use the |project_name| dock and the |project_name|
  Function Centric Wizard; and

- Be able to use the Generic Impact Function and understand how to use
  it to work with their own data.

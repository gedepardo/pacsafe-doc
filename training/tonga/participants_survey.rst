To help us give you the best possible workshop, we would like to understand your current knowledge of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Disaster Risk Management (DRM) concepts as well as the type of work you and your organisation do. 
There are no right or wrong answers. Your responses will help us plan the workshop to your needs. Please add as much detail as possible and if you do not know the answer to a question, indicate this and we will ensure to add it to the workshop.

This Training Manual has been prepared for the |project_name| Training
Workshop hosted by National Emergency Management Office, Tonga (April
2017). Material was prepared by |GA| and |SPC|, based on the InaSAFE
training programs prepared by Kartoza.

**Preface**


As a highly hazard-prone country, Tonga faces significant risk of loss
of lives and challenges to development progress as a result of natural
disasters. The development of disaster management plans is seen as an
important step to strengthen disaster risk reduction
programs. However, this can only be effective when risk assessments
and contingency planning utilise realistic hazard scenarios. Realistic
hazard scenarios require scientific, sound and up-to-date data hazard
information as well as up-to-date, scale-appropriate exposure
data. Such map-based risk assessments and contingency plans contribute
to better disaster management planning and response.

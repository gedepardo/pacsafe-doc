Running PacSAFE
===============

Introduction
------------

In this exercise, we will work through an example scenario where we
show how the different data elements used by PacSAFE are combined in
order to analyse the potential impact of a tsunami on both the
buildings and population.

After we have run the PacSAFE analysis we will print the map and
analysis report as a pdf and review the results. We will also learn
how to change the inundation threshold and take a look at the default
settings for minimum needs. We will also learn how to save our work.

Learning objective
------------------

To develop the participant's basic understanding of the PacSAFE
workflow and application of PacSAFE in the Disaster Management
sector. By the end of this exercise, participants will:


*   Be able to run a tsunami analysis using PacSAFE - on buildings;
*   Be able to run a tsunami analysis using PacSAFE - on population;
*   Understand the tsunami impact default settings;
*   Understand the impact summary report;
*   Be able to change the analysis threshold and run a new scenario;
*   Be able to generate a PDF map from the results of an analysis; and
*   Be able to save their work to share results with others.



Data for this exercise
......................

The data for this exercise are packaged in the PacSAFE
application. There is no need to download data to run the exercises.

Open |project_name| application
...............................

Before running a |project_name| analysis, we must open a
project. Start |project_name| by double clicking the |project_name|
icon on the desktop.

.. image:: /images/icon.ico
   :align: center


A splash screen will appear for a few seconds, then the main
|project_name| interface will be displayed.

.. image:: /images/splash.png
   :align: center


Choose a disaster scenario
..........................

Clicking on the |project_name| button in the |project_name| toolbar
will open a new window, with a list of projects that you can select
from.

.. figure:: /images/001_project_selection.png
   :align: center

   Project selection window for PacSAFE.

We will start by examining the scenario of a tsunami and it's impact
on buildings in and around Nuku'alofa. Select the "Nukualofa tsunami
buildings" project in the list, then click the "Load" button.

The project will show several layers, including:

* Buildings: this is the exposure data. This will be used to assess
  the tsunami impact on buildings.
* Tsunami: this is the hazard data. It is used to determine the
  inundation depth from a tsunami.
* Imagery: this is contextual data, and is aerial imagery over
  Nuku'alofa. This provides a sense of place and scale when viewing
  the results of analysis. It is not used in the analysis.

Use the panning tools to navigate around the map
(:ref:`navigate`). You might want to find your home, or a local
school.

The contextual data should help you to find features of interest, such
as your home, local school, or church.

Run PacSAFE Analysis for Buildings
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Take a look at the |project_name| dock on the right side of the
screen. The |project_name| dock should show that you are ready to run
a tsunami analysis. It poses the question "in the event of **a tsunami
generated by a Mw 9.0 earthquake**, how many **buildings** might **be
inundated**?". This analysis will use the default thresholds for low,
medium and high hazard zones - we will explore that later.

   PacSAFE dock showing it is ready to run an analysis.

Notice that the third element in the |project_name| dock, under
"Summarise the results by" is greyed out. This option is used for
aggregating the results (:ref:`aggregation`). We will cover
aggregation in a later exercise.

Click the :guilabel:`Run` button in the lower right corner of the
|project_name| dock to start the analysis process. After a few
seconds, you should get a result in the dock area, and several new
layers should be added to the map. You will see these new layers
listed in the layers panel.

Interpret the results
.....................

The new impact layer will be generated and called **Estimated buildings
affected**. Let's take a look at the new impact layer
generated by |project_name|.

- Zoom in to some area on the map canvas

- Here, we zoomed in to an area near the centre of Nuku'alofa. There will be different colours generated from |project_name| (green, yellow, orange, red).

.. note:: If you dont see these colours, you might need to turn off teh data layer above the "Estimated buildings affected" layer.

- The red buildings are inundated to a depth of XX metres, the orange buildings inundated to YY metres, The green buildings are considered *unaffected*, as they are situated in dry areas according to the inundation model.

Click :guilabel:`Estimated buildings affected` in the layer list to select it and click :guilabel:`Identify Feature` tool and then click on a building to view the attributes of that building.

In the |project_name| panel we now see the impact summary. The details of are
explained below.

   :width: 200 pt

-  **Hazard Category**: divides the results into several categories
   based on the threshold set in the hazard analysis. In this impact
   summary, |project_name| divides the impact buildings into three
   categories: number of buildings inundated (buildings affected by
   water deeper than the analysis threshold), number of wet buildings
   (buildings affected by flood water but not as deep as the analysis
   threshold), and number of dry buildings (buildings that are not
   affected by any flood water)

-  **Building type:** divides the exposed buildings into several
   categories based on the building type attribute for each
   building. In this impact summary, |project_name| breaks down the results
   into a more detailed report by looking at each type of the
   building, for example the number of inundated hospitals and the
   total number of hospitals in analysis area.

-  **Action checklist:** designed to make disaster managers think about
   what they need to do/discuss when planning for a similar event in
   the future.

-  **Notes & assumptions:** provides details about the input data and
   any limitations or assumptions in the analysis or report
   summary. In this example, it explains why buildings are said to be
   inundated, wet and dry.

-  **Detailed building type report:** statistical breakdown of the building
   types affected by the simulated event. When you choose to use an aggregation
   layer with your analysis (we will do this later) this table will show the
   number of buildings by aggregation boundary.

-  **Hazard details:** explains where the hazard data come from

-  **Exposure detail:** explains where the exposure come from

The results show the buildings that will be affected by flood water 1 metre deep. But what if the disaster manager decides that buildings in 80cm of water are also flooded? In order to assess this new scenario, we need to change the water depth threshold at which buildings are considered to be inundated. 

With |project_name| it is easy to run a new scenario, all you need to do is change the **Thresholds [m]** in the Options tab to 0.8 and run the scenario again.
We will do this next.



Reading the Impact Summary report

   Impact summary report for tsunami on buildings analysis.

Notice how the "Analysis detail" section has sub-headings "High hazard
zone", "Medium hazard zone" and "Low hazard zone"? You can select the
thresholds that define these zones, using the "Keyword Creation
Wizard"

Run PacSAFE Analysis for Population

Return to the |project_name| toolbar and click on the |project_name| button to open the project selection window. This time, select the "Nukualofa tsunami
population" project in the list, then click the "Load" button.

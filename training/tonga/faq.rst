Frequently Asked Questions
==========================
A short list of questions to assist course participants with the common
questions asked by new users when performing a natural disaster scenario
analysis with
QGIS and |project_name|.


1. What are the important things that need to prepared before running |project_name|?

   - To run |project_name| you need one hazard dataset and one exposure dataset.
   - The data must have keywords defined (current version) and it must be turned on.
   - There must be an overlap between the hazard and exposure layers.
   - See more in :ref:`pacsafe_concepts`


2. Why are there is no active layers available in the |project_name| dock?

   - Check that your data layers are turned on
   - Check that the layers have keywords defined.
   - If keywords are not defined or are not current, use the keywords wizard.


3. The data has keywords defined, but it is not showing up in the dock as an option for |project_name| analysis?

   - Check the keyword version is the same with the |project_name| version.
   - Use the keywords wizard to and update your keywords if necessary.
   - Check that the layer appears in the map and is turned on.


4. The data has keywords and is showing up in the dock, but there is no option in the "might" list?

   - The impact function for that data might not be available yet.
   - See the list of available impact functions in :ref:`pacsafe_concepts`.


5. Can PacSAFE summarise the impact summary results for different areas?

   - Yes, you can use the aggregation feature in |project_name| to summarise the
     impact summary results for smaller areas such as administration districts.


6. Why are there no options for population in the keyword for my vector population data?

   - The current version of |project_name| only supports raster population data.
   - Make sure that your population data in in raster format
   - See more in :ref:`pacsafe_concepts`


7. Can |project_name| be used to analyse hazard data besides flood, tsunami, earthquake, cyclone and volcanic hazard?

   - Yes it can. |project_name| has a Generic Hazard Impact Function that can
     be used to analyse other hazards as long as the data are classified.
   - Classified data will have values such as Low, Medium and High.


8. Why is there some data that is not relevant showing on my pdf map when I print?

   - Before you click the "Print" button, please turn off any layers you do not
     want to see on the map.
   - Rearrange the order of layers to make sure the important things are on top.


9. Why are the impact results different in different parts of the impact report?

   - In the general report the results are rounded.
   - In the detailed report the results may not be rounded as much.
   - |project_name| provides an estimate of the impact. Rounded numbers are good estimates.


10. My hazard and exposure data have different projections, can I still run an |project_name| analysis on these data?

    - Yes you can, but you need to enable on the fly projection.
    - In QGIS, activate OTF CRS Transformation
       - :menuselection:`Project > Project Properties > CRS`
       - checkbox in the :guilabel:`Enable 'on the fly' CRS transformation`.


11. My flood polygon hazard data includes a flood depth. Why can't I run an analysis in |project_name| and set the threshold with these data?

    - At this moment, users can only set a flood depth threshold for raster data.
    - If you would like to build a new impact function to work with different
      types of hazard data, please contact the developer team.
